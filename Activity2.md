# Activity 2: Seaspan Ferry Scheduling Visualization
_Presented by - Jagjit Singh and Jeremy Zhang_

###Assumptions
1) We assume that a ferry takes and hour to load and unload on a dock.
2)
###What Why How
WHAT?

We have table as - DATASET
The table represents ferry schedule.
SO, ferry (Vessel) - ITEM
Ferry timings are its attributes
SO, departure and arrival times - ATTRIBUTES
Ferry timings have cyclic nature and therefore have ordering direction - CYCLIC
Since the entire data table is available at once to analyze this is - STTAIC DATASET AVAILABILITY

WHY?

We have to use visualization because we have some information already available that we have to (CONSUME) by finding the ways we can better utilize the vessels(DISCOVER) and then present it in a form that is more easy to understand for domain experts(PRESENT).

The next step is to look up (SEARCH) visualization for sailings that have more load and berths(LOOKUP) that have free time to be used and eventually increase sailings.

Final sept is to compare(QUERY) the routes that are more popular than other to reach a decision(COMPARE).

HOW?

Firstly, validating the domain situation and designing the visual encoding we apply the algorithm to achieve the design presented. Each ferry docks at a port and takes an hour time and giving us an idea on how free the port is for multiple ferry rides.
###Design-Study
If we follow the design study methodology for this task, we will divide the visualization process into nine stages and keep an eye on pitfalls during each level:
1. Precondition
* Learn - Getting knowledge on visualization techniques, design and interaction techniques. Learning evaluation for visualization for use in later stage of process.
* Winnow - Will arrange a couple of meetings with Seaspan company to identify actual collaborators. This stage is MOST IMPORTANT so will try spend more time and try to avoid pitfalls.
* Cast - Next step will be assigning roles to people in collaboration and identifying gatekeeper and front-line analyst.
2. Core
* Discover - A fine understanding of target domain and study problems, requirements and needs of domain expert so our visualization can help them to get insight into the system.
* Design - After you have the same understanding as the domain experts its time to design the visualization.
* Implement - Start the process of rapid prototyping and demonstrate it by integrating it with old workflows.
* Deploy - Its time to put our design to implementation, deploy the system and gather feedback from the domain experts, is this really helpful ?
3. Analysis
* Reflect - How our design can reflect back on the design study and can be cross implemented with different platforms. Refine the guidelines used and reject the one that never worked.
* Write - The last step will be to document our work, design-study paper is the final output of the process.

###Important pitfalls to be considered:
1) PF-2: We understand that this a part of the class activity, but we do not have sufficient knowledge of the vis literature. We have been introduced to "WHAT?" and "WHY?" but no idea on "HOW?".
2) PF-5: Visualization requires time commitment from domain experts also best design results are achieved if these studies are conducted in the workplace of collaborators.
